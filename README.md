# Mastering Docker
Mastering Docker - Through .NET Core a 2-day classroom session held in Pune, IN on 8/9th Feb 2020

## Course Overview
Docker is a platform to develop, build and test applications within an isolated environment. .NET Core is a cross-platform application development framework to build 
web applications, web APIs, and mobile applications. 
Using .NET core and docker we’ll build applications that are powerful, strong, cloud-ready 
and yet extremely modular and flexible to be changed very easily.

## Module 01 – Basic of Virtualization
Understanding how software consolidate physical computing resources to dynamically and flexibly provision a simulation of multiple computers

## Module 02 - Introduction to Docker
The ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.

## Module 03 - Docker Command Line Interface
Enables you to perform operations with a docker container by sending commands to the docker daemon process.

## Module 04 - Dockerizing .NET Applications
Setting up a machine with all the dependencies required to run the application code.

## Module 05 - Developing Applications with Docker
Develop a .NET Core Application. Dockerize the application using Dockerfile.

## Module 06 - Developing multi-container Docker Application
Learn how to develop and ship containerized applications by walking through a sample that exhibits practices involved in Dockerizing applications

## Module 07 - Introduction to Microservices
Microservices are a software development technique. They are a variant of the service-oriented architecture structural style. It arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight

## Module 08 - Handling Error and container crashes
A failing container can restart by correct configuration. Through Docker CLI has commands to view logs of a container. .NET Core has built in API to support logging.

## Module 09 - Container Orchestration
As application load increases it makes sense to add more container instances to the solution 
With these instances increasing they need a load balancer to distribute the load with some strategy

## Module 10 - Introduction to Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

## Module 11 - Kubernetes Deployment
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

## Module 12 - Azure Kubernetes Services
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) manages your hosted Kubernetes environment, making it quick and easy to deploy and manage containerized applications without container orchestration expertise
